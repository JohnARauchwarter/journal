The Coral Castle
---

On my drive home today, the [Coral Castle](https://coralcastle.com/) came to my mind.  It is an amazing structure, built relatively recently by a single person out of massive blocks.  For years its construction defied explanation, leading to odd explanations, from ancient tech, to alien help, to supernatural powers.
